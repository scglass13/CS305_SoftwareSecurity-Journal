- Client and Software Requirements:
  - The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that creates customized financial plans for clients, covering savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.
  - They sought assistance from Global Rain to modernize their operations and enhance the security of their web-based software, given the sensitivity of financial data they handle and the need for secure communication. The primary issue was protecting against external threats.

- Success in Identifying Vulnerabilities:
  - I successfully identified key areas of security concern, such as input validation, APIs, cryptography, code errors, code quality, and encapsulation.
  - Secure coding is crucial because it prevents data breaches, unauthorized access, and data corruption, which can damage a company's reputation and result in legal and financial consequences.
  
- Challenging Aspects of the Assessment:
  - The challenging aspect was the identification of specific vulnerabilities through static testing, as this required expertise in recognizing known security issues.
  - I did not delve into dynamic testing or penetration testing, which could have provided a deeper assessment of the software's security.

- Increasing Layers of Security and Future Assessments:
  - To enhance security, I recommended actions like using the latest Bouncy Castle JCE Provider, updating Spring Boot, implementing user validation, writing high-quality code, avoiding hard-coded sensitive information, and ensuring encapsulation.
  - In future assessments, it's important that I perform dynamic testing, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify vulnerabilities comprehensively and apply relevant mitigation techniques.
  
- Ensuring Functional and Secure Code:
  - In the assessment, I highlighted issues and recommended improvements.
  - To ensure the code's functionality and security, thorough testing should be conducted to identify and address any new vulnerabilities introduced during the refactoring process.
    
- Resources, Tools, and Practices:
  - I recommended using up-to-date software versions, secure coding practices, and code quality standards, which are valuable for future assignments.
  - Tools such as security scanners, static code analyzers, and security libraries can be employed to identify vulnerabilities.
    
- Demonstrating Skills to Future Employers:
  -This assignment can be presented to future employers as an example of my ability to conduct vulnerability assessments and provide mitigation strategies to enhance software security.
  -I can showcase my proficiency in identifying security vulnerabilities and providing practical recommendations for mitigating them, aligning with industry best practices.
